## About
> This is a resting place for some globle rules or filters (in .txt format) whose owners or users have no interest on upating them because of out-of-life or simply are-not-necessary. RIP! Some of the greatest filters (You guys can still serve your purposes though, sort of...).

> For the 'mixture' of two or more rules or filters, the big ones need break down to work properly which is according to the after-checking result of the 'mixture'.

> You can request adding of your own filters (even after new styles of redundancy checking!) to this place (a host actually...).

## Recent development 
>  (too lazy to add comit comment :P, the most recent is on top)

> Work with the organisation of the mixture to reduce file size which can ensure availability. Notes are rewriiten in the [info.txt]().
Also, name of the files are changed for simplifcatiion.
