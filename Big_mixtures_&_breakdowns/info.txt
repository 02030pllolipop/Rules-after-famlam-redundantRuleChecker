All the mixture has been performed in the following order:
1. Redundant check within themselves 
2. Cross check among the lists in the mixture
3. Cross check with the Easylist rule, and doing 2. each time after that cross check (https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt)
4. One final cross check among the lists in the mixture
5. If more errors, more cross check :P
